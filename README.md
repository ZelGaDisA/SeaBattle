# Battleship (Морской бой)

### [Live preview](https://twentysixhugs.github.io/Battleship/)

---

## Key features

- **The AI is clever, it will try to destroy your ship after hitting it by attacking adjacent cells instead of the random ones.**
- Ships can be generated and placed randomly.
- Ship placement is validated, they cannot not be placed adjacent to each other.
- Ship's surrounding is immediately attacked once the ship is hit
- It was written with TDD approach

## How to play?

- Your ships are already randomly placed. If you want to, you can shuffle them once again.
- Once the game has started, you need to guess where the computer's ships are and attack them. So does the computer.
- When you hit a ship, you can try to sink it (You have an extra move). The one who destroyes all the opponent's ships wins the game.
- Remember, the computer is not stupid, it will try to sink your ship after hitting it as was mentioned before.
